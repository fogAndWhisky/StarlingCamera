THIS IS VERY OLD CODE AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a simple view component for the Starling AS3 Framework that allows you to integrate a Camera with the rest of Starling's display list.
Look at the Main and MainView classes for a simple tutorial.

StarlingCamera supports:
- Arbitrary size of camera
- Mirroring of the camera view
- Arbitrary framerate of the display for optimized performance
- Downsampling of the camera display for optimized performance
- A rotate flag to handle a bug on mobile AIR
- Full-resolution snapshot call (getImage())

Known issues:
- On IOS, the front-facing camera is higher resolution than the rear camera. This makes the image seem unnaturally zoomed.
 I'll post a fix when I can.
- A bug on Air for IOS causes the camera to rotate 90 degrees. This is handled in StarlingCamera by allowing the developer
 to pass in a rotate flag as part of the init() method.
